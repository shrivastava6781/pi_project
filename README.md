## Student Dashboard

- When a user logs in as a **Student**, they should see **2 tabs**:

  2. **Forms**.

### My Responses Tab

- The **My Responses** tab should:

  - Display the responses in the form of **Cards**.

### Forms Tab

- The **Forms** tab should include a form with the following fields:
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone
  - Profile Picture
- **Each field is required**.
- Upon submitting the form, the user should be redirected to the **My Responses** tab.
- The latest response should be displayed in the **My Responses** tab.

## Admin Dashboard

- The **All Responses** tab should:
  - Call an **API** to retrieve all the submitted responses by all users.
  - Display the responses as **Cards**.
- Each card should have a **delete button**.
